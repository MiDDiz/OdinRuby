## Caesar Cypher 
This is basically a small snipet of code that emulates the famous [Roman-era caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

## Substrings 
The function substrings returns the number of times a substring contained in a set of words is found. 

## Stock Picker
This function will get the value from an array which is most profitable in a buy/sell situation. It has to be passed an array of stocks that holds a value for each day.
Being each day an instance in the array. Ex: Day 1 Array[0], Day 2 Array[1]...  

## Bubble sort
Basic implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. 
I added a little tweak. As stated in many sources, given the iteration number i, you just have to check the n - i elements of the array because the furthest one will be already sorted.
